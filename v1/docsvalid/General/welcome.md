# Welcome to the Dimensions REST API

The Dimensions platform provides a powerful application programming interface and documentation to help you develop secure, scalable, and high-performance applications that leverage the full breadth of capabilities offered by our backend services.

The Dimensions API is founded on a pragmatic implementation of the [representational state transfer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_State_Transfer) architectural style and allows access to your organization's data using common HTTP methods and the [JSON](http://www.json.org) interchange format.

Our extensible platform allows any application you build to access your data, from a mobile companion app to a full-featured client unique to your organization and its needs.

To learn more, begin with our [Getting started](C:636f581c-50a8-41a7-af43-e5057f9c20bd) documentation. You may also wish to read the [Overview](C:0df07e3a-7e83-47c8-9ae6-ecf71ce5f4e7) before trying out the API yourself by [Making an API call](C:3ca261ba-fc8b-4354-a2b1-6892e006c046). Once you've familiarized yourself with the basics, be sure to check out our collection of [guides](C:92b16358-756a-41bf-9204-b0aaf7262cfa).
